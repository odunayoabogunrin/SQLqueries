**INTRODUCTION**
---------------------------------


In this project, I will be using SQL to query the database of an organization to perform a profit and brand analysis of their products


**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
---------------------------------------

A brewery company is planning for the next year (2020) and seeks to know ways through which they can maximize profit and reduce their losses. In a bid to access the profitability of the business, I will be querying the sales record of the company between 2017-2019.

**PROFIT ANALYSIS**
------------------------------------------------------

In the space of three years under review, the Territory Manager of the organization will like to know which region and country generated the highest and lowest income in order to know what measures to put in place in order to maximize profit in the years ahead.
The following queries will give insights that will help him/her make the right decisions:

1. What region generated the highest profit?

   ![](Regional_Sales.png)


   _The francophone region generated more profit than the anglophone region_

2. Which countries generated the highest profit in the three years under review?
  
  
                                             Top 3 Countries in 2017

                                             Top 3 Countries in 2018

   ![](2019_Top3.PNG)
   
   
   _In 2017 and 2018, sales made in Nigeria generated the highest profit among the countries where the company's products were sold in the anglophone and   francophone region. However, in 2019, Ghana had the highest profit_
 

3. Within the three years under review, in what year was the highest profit generated?

   ![](Sales_Years.PNG)
  
   _In all the three years under review, the highest income was generated in 2017 while the least income was generated in 2019. This implies that sales has dwindled over the years_



4. Since it has been established that the least profit was generated in 2019, I will like to dive into the profit generated in 2019 and ascertain the percentage profit for each month. What is the profit in percentage for each month in 2019?

   ![](Percentage_2019.PNG)
   
   _In 2019, the highest income was generated in January while the least profit was generated in February_

  
5. I will like to compare if the trend of sales by months in 2017 and 2018 are the same as that of 2019. So what is the profit in percentage for each month in 2017 and 2018?

   2017                                               |     2018

   ![](Percentage_2017.PNG)                           |    ![](Percentage_2018.PNG)
   
   _The profit trend by months in both 2017 and 2018 differs from that of 2019. In 2017 and 2018, the highest profit was generated in May and February while the least profit was realized in June and May respectively._
   


**BRAND ANALYSIS**
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To have a better understanding of the sales trend by months and find a possible reason(s) why the total profit for 2019 was lower than the other years, I will do an analysis of the various brands of malt and beer produced by the company with the following queries:

1. What are the top three brands consumed in the francophone and anglophone countries in 2017 and 2019?

   FRANCOPHONE REGION (2017)                          |     FRANCOPHONE REGION (2019)
   :-------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:
   ![](Francophone_2017.PNG)                          |    ![](Francophone_2019.PNG)
   
    ANGLOPHONE REGION (2017)                          |     ANGLOPHONE REGION (2019)
   :-------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:
   ![](Anglophone_2017.PNG)                           |    ![](Anglophone_2019.PNG)
   
   _The top three brands for both years differ for both regions._
   
 2. The company had more profit in 2017 and 2018 when it generated more profit from Nigeria than any other country. So what brands were most consumed in 2017 and 2018 in Nigeria that considerably increased the profit margin of the company in both years?
 
    GOODS SOLD IN NIGERIA IN 2017                     |     GOODS SOLD IN NIGERIA IN 2018
    :------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:
    ![](Nigeria_2017.PNG)                             |     ![](Nigeria_2018.PNG)
    
    _Budweiser, Eagle Lager and Hero took the lead on the list of the most consumed brands in Nigeria in 2017 while Castle Lite, Trophy and Budweiser were the most sold brand in Nigeria in 2018._
    
 
 3. The profit generated in Nigeria in 2019 was low and it affected the overall income of the company in that year. How does the brands sold in Nigeria in 2019 compare to the brands sold in Ghana in the same year were Ghana recorded the highest profit?
    
    
    GOODS SOLD IN GHANA IN 2019                       |     GOODS SOLD IN NIGERIA IN 2019
    :------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:
    ![](Ghana_2019.PNG)                               |     ![](Nigeria_2019.PNG)
    
    _The top three brands consumed in Ghana are Grand malt, Hero and Beta Malt while Hero, Eagle Lager and Beta Malt were the top brands in Nigeria. Beta Malt appeared in the third position in both countries. Notably, Budweiser that was in the top 3 list of Nigeria's most consumed brands in 2017 and 2018 was in the 6th position in 2019._
   
4. Which region in Nigeria consumed the highest proportion of budweiser in 2019?
  ![](Budweiser_Nigeria_Regions.png)
  
  _In 2019, the South East region consumed Budweiser the most in 2019 while the South-South region consumed the least proportion of Budweiser_
  
  
5. What beers are consumed in Nigeria?

 ![](Beer_Consumption_Nigeria.png)
 
 _Budweiser tops the list as the most preferred brand in Nigeria_
 
 **CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION**
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	The francophone region generated more profit than the anglophone region

•	The profit generated by sales of the company's products had the highest value in Nigeria in both 2017 and 2018 while the highest profit was generated in Ghana in 2019.

•  Sales dropped considerably in Nigeria in 2019. As a result, the overall profit margin of the company reduced in 2019 compared to the other two years

•	The profit trend by months for all the years differs

•  Sales made in Nigeria has a huge impact on the overall profit margin of the company yearly

•  Budweiser seems to be the most preferred brand in Nigeria and in 2019 when the quantity of the brand sold was low, the profit realized was also low. Therefore, efforts should me to made to run some promotions on Budweiser in Nigeria so as to increase its sale and ultimately increase the profit margin of the company in the coming year.
