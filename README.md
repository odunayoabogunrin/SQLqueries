**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

A brewery company is planning for the next five years and seeks to know ways through which they can maximize profit and reduce their losses. In a bid to access the profitability of the business, I will be querying the sales record of the company between 2018-2020.

**PROFIT ANALYSIS**

In the space of three years under review, the Territory Manager of the organization will like to know which region and country generated the highest and lowest income in order to know what measures to put in place in order to maximize profit in the years ahead.
The following queries will give insights that will help him/her make the right decisions:

1. What region generated the highest profit?
